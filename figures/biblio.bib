abstract = {An early warning system (EWS) is a core type of data driven Internet of Things (IoTs) system used for environment disaster risk and effect management. The potential benefits of using a semantic-type EWS include easier sensor and data source plug-and-play, simpler, richer, and more dynamic metadata-driven data analysis and easier service interoperability and orchestration. The challenges faced during practical deployments of semantic EWSs are the need for scalable time-sensitive data exchange and processing (especially involving heterogeneous data sources) and the need for resilience to changing ICT resource constraints in crisis zones. We present a novel IoT EWS system framework that addresses these challenges, based upon a multisemantic representation model. We use lightweight semantics for metadata to enhance rich sensor data acquisition. We use heavyweight semantics for top level W3C Web Ontology Language ontology models describing multileveled knowledge-bases and semantically driven decision support and workflow orchestration. This approach is validated through determining both system related metrics and a case study involving an advanced prototype system of the semantic EWS, integrated with a deployed EWS infrastructure.},

Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.},

abstract = {With more people living in cities, urban sensing is urgently required to create a comfortable and convenient living environment. As Internet of Things (IoT) is the fundamental infrastructure to realize urban sensing, it should be flexible to support various application requirements and convenient management of infrastructure. Inspired by software-defined networking, which aims to make networks more flexible, the authors propose a software-defined IoT architecture for smart urban sensing. This architecture decouples urban sensing applications from the physical infrastructure. Centralized controllers are designed to manage physical devices and provide APIs of data acquisition, transmission, and processing services to develop urban sensing applications. With these properties, various applications can coexist on the shared infrastructure, and each application can request controllers to customize its data acquisition, transmission, and processing on-demand by generating specific configurations of physical devices. This article discusses the background, benefits, and design details of the proposed architecture as well as open problems and potential solutions to realize it, which opens a new research direction for IoT and urban sensing.},

Prior standards, and also oneM2M, while focusing on achieving interoperability at the communication level, do not achieve interoperability at the semantic level. An expressive ontology for IoT called IoT-O is proposed, making best use of already defined ontologies in specific domains such as sensor, observation, service, quantity kind, units, or time. IoT-O also defines some missing concepts relevant for IoT such as thing, node, actuator, and actuation. The extension of the oneM2M standard to support semantic data interoperability based on IoT-O is discussed. Finally, through comprehensive use cases, benefits of the extended standard are demonstrated, ranging from heterogeneous device interoperability to autonomic behavior achieved by automated reasoning.},

Publishing and integrating sensor data across these islands is difficult and labor- intensive. In this paper we present an approach and an infrastructure which makes sensor data available following the linked open data prin- ciple and enables the seamless integration of such data into mashups. SensorMasher publishes sensor data as Web data sources which can then easily be integrated with other (linked) data sources and sensor data. Raw sensor readings and sensors can be semantically described and an- notated by the user. These descriptions can then be exploited in mashups and in linked open data scenarios and enable the discovery and inte- gration of sensors and sensor data at large scale. The user-generated mashups of sensor data and linked open data can in turn be published as linked open data sources and be used by others.},

Part of the framework is instantiated in terms of building blocks and demonstrated through a smart city scenario that horizontally spans several application domains.

Each ICO will have one or more embedded sensors that will capture potentially enormous amounts of data. The sensors and related data streams can be clustered physically or virtually, which raises the challenge of searching and selecting the right sensors for a query in an efficient and effective way. This paper proposes a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model, called CASSARAM, to address the challenge of efficiently selecting a subset of relevant sensors out of a large set of sensors with similar functionality and capabilities. CASSARAM considers user preferences and a broad range of sensor characteristics such as reliability, accuracy, location, battery life, and many more. This paper highlights the importance of sensor search, selection and ranking for the IoT, identifies important characteristics of both sensors and data capture processes, and discusses how semantic and quantitative reasoning can be combined together. This paper also addresses challenges such as efficient distributed sensor search and relational-expression based filtering. CASSARAM testing and performance evaluation results are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently received considerable interest from both academia and industry that are working on technologies to develop the future Internet. It is a joint and complex discipline that requires synergetic efforts from several communities such as telecommunication industry, device manufacturers, semantic Web, and informatics and engineering. Much of the IoT initiative is supported by the capabilities of manu- facturing low-cost and energy-efficient hardware for devices with communication capacities, the maturity of wireless sensor network technologies, and the interests in integrating the physical and cyber worlds. However, the heterogeneity of the “Things” makes interoperability among them a challenging problem, which prevents generic solutions from being adopted on a global scale. Furthermore, the volume, velocity and volatility of the IoT data impose significant challenges to existing information systems. Semantic technologies based on machine-interpretable representation formalism have shown promise for describing objects, sharing and integrating information, and inferring new knowledge together with other intelligent processing techniques. However, the dynamic and resource-constrained nature of the IoT requires special design considerations to be taken into account to effectively apply the semantic technologies on the real world data. In this article the authors review some of the recent developments on applying the semantic technologies to IoT.},

This article presents a cognitive management framework for the IoT aiming to address these issues, comprising three levels of functionality: virtual objects (VOs), composite VOs (CVOs), and service levels. Cognitive entities at all levels provide the means for self-management (configuration, optimization, and healing) and learning. Three fundamental processes of this framework are presented: dynamic CVO creation, knowledge-based CVO instantiation, and CVO self-healing.

abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.},

@article{Ganz2015,
abstract = {The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interaction and communication between billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real-world objects (i.e. things). Extracting higher level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract, and characterize meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machine-understandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring, and smart home applications, and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data. A considerable amount of methods from machine-learning, the semantic web, as well as pattern and data mining have been used to abstract from sensor observations to information representations. This paper provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current state-of-the-art in this area. This paper also identifies research directions at the edge of information abstraction for sensor data. To ease the understanding of the abstraction workflow process, we introduce a software toolkit that implements the introduced techniques and motivates to apply them on various data sets.},

We build upon the current state-of-the-art ontologies to provide contextual information and set of policies to execute services. Our knowledge base consists of several ontologies viz, resource, location, context {\&} domain, policy and service ontologies. This helps in building a unified knowledge representation for IoT entities. In our knowledge base, we specifically model dynamic environments in which IoT entities operate.

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a major paradigm shift from traditional Internet applications that connects things / objects to the Internet for automatic sensing, information processing, understanding, reasoning, decision and response to virtual and physical world. Due to its highly distributed and heterogeneous characteristics, it requires more semantic interactions between different scenarios. Therefore, interoperability is one of the most fundamental requirements for IoT systems. Currently, semantic modeling for IoT applications has significant deficiency in its reusability and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a semantic information model for IoT applications, named OntoIoT. This model has a two-level architecture including a set of general upper ontology and flexible interfaces for different application domain ontology extensions. We have preliminarily implemented the OntoIoT framework and domain extension in selected scenarios of smart space and healthcare. A data-driven and other ontology evaluation approaches are used to prove the scalability and interoperability of OntoIoT. Result demonstrates that, compared to other test ontologies, Onto IoT is more suitable for the given application scenario.},

@article{Le-Phuoc2012,
abstract = {The Web has long exceeded its original purpose of a distributed hypertext system and has become a global, data sharing and processing platform. This development is confirmed by remarkable milestones such as the Semantic Web, Web services, social networks and mashups. In parallel with these developments on the Web, the Internet of Things (IoT), i.e., sensors and actuators, has matured and has become a major scientific and economic driver. Its potential impact cannot be overestimated–for example, in logistics, cities, electricity grids and in our daily life, in the form of sensor-laden mobile phones–and rivals that of the Web itself. While the Web provides ease of use of distributed resources and a sophisticated development and deployment infrastructure, the IoT excels in bringing real-time information from the physical world into the picture. Thus a combination of these players seems to be the natural next step in the development of even more sophisticated systems of systems. While only starting, there is already a significant amount of sensor-generated, or more generally dynamic information, available on the Web. However, this information is not easy to access and process, depends on specialised gateways and requires significant knowledge on the concrete deployments, for example, resource constraints and access protocols. To remedy these problems and draw on the advantages of both sides, we try to make dynamic, online sensor data of any form as easily accessible as resources and data on the Web, by applying well-established Web principles, access and processing methods, thus shielding users and developers from the underlying complexities. In this paper we describe our Linked Stream Middleware (LSM, http://lsm.deri.ie/), which makes it easy to integrate time-dependent data with other Linked Data sources, by enriching both sensor sources and sensor data streams with semantic descriptions, and enabling complex SPARQL-like queries across both dataset types through a novel query processing engine, along with means to mashup the data and process results. Most prominently, LSM provides (1) extensible means for real-time data collection and publishing using a cloud-based infrastructure, (2) a Web interface for data annotation and visualisation, and (3) a SPARQL endpoint for querying unified Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. We describe the system architecture behind LSM, provide details of how Linked Stream Data is generated, and demonstrate the benefits and efficiency of the platform by showcasing some experimental evaluations and the system's interface.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) with billions of connected devices has been generating an enormous amount of data every hour. Connecting every data item generated by IoT to the rest of the digital world to turn this data into meaningful actions will create new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunities for businesses, individuals, and countries. However, providing an integrated view for exploring and querying such data at real-time is extremely challenging due to its Big Data natures: big volume, fast real-time update and messy data sources. To address this challenge, we provide a unified integrated and live view for heterogeneous IoT data sources using Linked Data, called the Graph of Things (GoT). GoT is backed by a scalable and elastic software stack to deal with billions of records of historical and static datasets in conjunction with millions of triples being fetched and enriched to connect to GoT per hour in real time. GoT makes approximately a half of million stream data sources queryable via a SPARQL endpoint and a continuous query channel that enable us to create a live explorer of GoT (http://graphofthings.org/) with just HTML and Javascript.},

Generating an abstraction requires inferring explanations from an incomplete set of observations (often from the Web) and updating these explanations on the basis of new information. This process must be fast and efficient. The authors' approach overcomes these challenges to systematically derive abstractions from observations. The approach models perception through the integration of an abductive logic framework called Parsimonious Covering Theory with Semantic Web technologies.

Context awareness introduces a new level of intelligence that can be exploited in order to improve the efficiency of communication networks. The semantic routing proposed here is achieved in a completely distributed fashion. Distributed routing has been found to be effective for achieving scalable information dissemination in publish/subscribe communication systems. In this paper a novel method is proposed for designing sensor network ontology and for routing information through the network by using a distributed minimum semantic spanning tree approach.

abstract = {Sensor networks are used in various applications in several domains for measuring and determining physical phenomena and natural events. Sensors enable machines to capture and observe characteristics of physical objects and features of natural incidents. Sensor networks generate immense amount of data which requires advanced analytical processing and interpretation by machines. Most of the current efforts on sensor networks are focused on networking and service development for various applications, but less on processing the emerging data. Sensor data in a real world application will be an integration of various data obtained from different sensors such as temperature, pressure, and humidity. Processing and interpretation of huge amounts of heterogeneous sensor data and utilising a coherent structure for this data is an important aspect of a scalable and interoperable sensor network architecture. This paper describes a semantic model for heterogeneous sensor data representation. We use common standards and logical description frameworks proposed by the semantic Web community to create a sensor data description model. The work describes a sen- sor data ontology which is created according to the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) and SensorML data component models. We describe how the semantic relationship and operational constraints are deployed in a uniform structure to describe the hetero- geneous sensor data.},

@article{Calbimonte2011,
abstract = {Sensor network deployments are a primary source of massive amounts of data about the real world that surrounds us, measuring a wide range of physical properties in real time. However, in large-scale deployments it becomes hard to effectively exploit the data captured by the sensors, since there is no precise information about what devices are available and what properties they measure. Even when metadata is available, users need to know low-level details such as database schemas or names of properties that are specific to a device or platform. Therefore the task of coherently searching, correlating and combining sensor data becomes very challenging.We propose an ontology-based approach, that consists in exposing sensor observations in terms of ontologies enriched with semantic metadata, providing information such as: which sensor recorded what, where, when, and in which conditions. For this, we allow defining virtual semantic streams, whose ontological terms are related to the underlying sensor data schemas through declarative mappings, and can be queried in terms of a high level sensor network ontology. 1},

@techreport{Lefort2011,
abstract = {This document is the final report of the W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group. The group had two main objectives. The first was to develop an ontology to describe sensors and sensor networks for use in sensor network and sensor web applications. The second was to study and recommend methods for using the ontology to semantically enable applications developed according to available standards such as the Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards. The Sensor and Sensor Network ontology presented here, known as the SSN ontology, answers the need for a domain-independent and end-to-end model for sensing applications by merging sensor-focused (e.g. SensorML), observation-focused (e.g. Observation {\&} Measurement) and system-focused views. It covers the sub-domains which are sensor-specific such as the sensing principles and capabilities and can be used to define how a sensor will perform in a particular context to help characterise the quality of sensed data or to better task sensors in unpredictable environments. Although the ontology leaves the observed domain unspecified, domain semantics, units of measurement, time and time series, and location and mobility ontologies can be easily attached when instantiating the ontology for any particular sensors in a domain. The alignment between the SSN ontology and the DOLCE Ultra Lite upper ontology has helped to normalise the structure of the ontology to assist its use in conjunction with ontologies or linked data resources developed elsewhere. While the OGC SWE standards provide description and access to data and metadata for sensors, they do not provide facilities for abstraction, categorization, and reasoning offered by semantic technologies. This report presents a semantic annotation method defined by the XG. This method should help the users of OGC standards to retrofit XML-based web services to better support semantic mashups and to ease the integration with linked open data applications relying on semantic web technologies like RDF and SPARQL. Finally, this report identifies where ongoing research and standardisation efforts are likely to benefit from the work done by this Incubator Activity and also where further work is required. Three directions for future work have been identified: - standardise the SSN ontology to use it in a Linked Sensor Data context - standardise the SSN ontology to bridge the Internet of Things and the Internet of Services - foster the adoption of the SSN ontology in the OGC community More than 25 papers discussing applications of the SSN XG work have been published by the XG participants and by early adopters which were not directly involved in the ontology development but were closely following it via the mailing list and the wiki. This is a clear signal that there is an good prospect for the creation of W3C community group focused on the maintenance and extension of the SSN Ontology. This is the first recommendation issued by the group. The group's decision to align the SSN Ontology with DOLCE Ultra Lite has raised specific challenges for the publication, packaging and maintenance of the SSN Ontology which are not frequently addressed by other W3C groups publishing recommendations focusing on ontologies. The second recommendation is to encourage further work on these issues at W3C. The third recommendation made by the group is to encourage its participants and followers to join the Provenance working group to work on sensor-specific issues. The fourth recommendation requests the W3C to promote uptake of the SSN ontology in the W3C community and beyond. The final recommendation of this report is to encourage W3C and OGC to coordinate their activities in this area and especially to build a larger pool of experts to tackle the challenges linked to differences between the modelling approach used by the group, based on OWL, and the modelling principles currently applied within the OGC community.},

@article{Kiljander2014,
abstract = {Pervasive computing and Internet of Things (IoTs) paradigms have created a huge potential for new business. To fully realize this potential, there is a need for a common way to abstract the heterogeneity of devices so that their functionality can be represented as a virtual computing platform. To this end, we present novel semantic level interoperability architecture for pervasive computing and IoTs. There are two main principles in the proposed architecture. First, information and capabilities of devices are represented with semantic web knowledge representation technologies and interaction with devices and the physical world is achieved by accessing and modifying their virtual representations. Second, global IoT is divided into numerous local smart spaces managed by a semantic information broker (SIB) that provides a means to monitor and update the virtual representation of the physical world. An integral part of the architecture is a resolution infrastructure that provides a means to resolve the network address of a SIB either using a physical object identifier as a pointer to information or by searching SIBs matching a specification represented with SPARQL. We present several reference implementations and applications that we have developed to evaluate the architecture in practice. The evaluation also includes performance studies that, together with the applications, demonstrate the suitability of the architecture to real-life IoT scenarios. In addition, to validate that the proposed architecture conforms to the common IoT-A architecture reference model (ARM), we map the central components of the architecture to the IoT-ARM.},

abstract = {As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is being applied for stovepipe solutions, since it presents a semantic description limited to a specific domain. IoT needs to be pushed towards a more open, interoperable and collaborative IoT. The first step has been the Web of Things (WoT). WoT evolves the IoT with a common stack based on web services. But, even when a homogeneous access is reached through web protocols, a common understanding is not yet acquired. For this purpose, the Semantic Web of Things (SWoT) is proposed for the integration of the semantic web on the WoT. This work analyses the SWoT, presenting its different levels to offer an IoT convergence. Specifically, we analyse the trends for capillary networks and for cellular networks with standards such as IPSO, ZigBee, OMA, and the oneM2M initiative. This work also analyses the impact of the semantic-annotations/metadata in the performance of the resources.},

abstract = {The vision of Internet of Things is to connect everyday objects through embedding wireless devices, so that they can interact with each other and provide new services. One of major challenges for the IoT is the heterogeneous problem. Information generated by different IoT objects will not be compatible, which hinders data communications between the IoT objects. In this paper, we study semantic technology for integrating heterogeneous information in the IoT. We propose to use ontologies to model the schema of data generated by the IoT objects, and propose a hybrid ontology matching approach to solve the heterogeneous problem. The proposed approach uses multiple matchers to compute similarities between ontology elements, and computes weight for each matcher by making use of the hierarchical structure of ontology. Experimental results show that our method can effectively filter out wrong mappings and obtain alignments with high quality between ontologies.},

abstract = {With the Internet of Things (IoT), we are facing a proliferation of connected devices distributed over a collection of geographical locations and offering new services to users referred to as IoT services. These services are highly heterogeneous and their number is growing fast. To facilitate IoT service search, some solutions rely on the use of Semantic Web technologies to create homogenous service descriptions to reason on and support accurate and flexible search. However, most existing approaches are centralized and fail to scale with respect to the number of advertised services. To address this scalability issue, we present in this paper a distributed, semantic-based IoT service search system. It relies on a hierarchical network of semantic gateways that represent geographical locations and host semantic service descriptions. To answer a service query, our approach is based on request matching and forwarding though the use of routing tables and similarity thresholds. Based on defined metrics, recursive clustering and information aggregation are performed over the hierarchy of gateways to construct the routing tables. We prove theoretically that our method ensures an accurate search of all matching services within the system. Experimental results show that our method enables to reduce greatly search cost with comparison to a centralized approach and has an acceptable search path length.},

The SIoT exceeds the more traditional paradigm of IoT with an enhanced intelligence and context-awareness. In this paper, a novel service framework based on a cognitive reasoning approach for dynamic SIoT services discovery in smart spaces is proposed. That is, reasoning about users' situational needs, preferences, and other social aspects along with users' surrounding environment is proposed for generating a list of situation-aware services which matches users' needs. This reasoning approach is then implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype, namely Airport Dynamic Social, within a smart airport. Finally, an empirical study to evaluate the reasoning approach's efficiency shows improved services adaptability to situational needs compared to common approaches proposed in literature.},

This is the case with Project Haystack, a framework to tag devices with labels from a predefined vocabulary in the field of Building Automation. In order to make Project Haystack standard and fully semantic, we wrapped its vocabulary in an ontology. In this paper, we present the general structure of this ontology, along with a method to turn tag sets into a Semantic Web model and back. The whole results in a reusable ontology design pattern. We aligned our Haystack tagging ontology with the wide-spreaded Semantic Sensor Network upper ontology and we designed a configuration environment for Building Automation systems based on semantic data to illustrate, so as to discuss the added-value of semantics in automation.},

abstract = {Today's Internet is shifting towards a larger and smarter scenario known as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT envisions a multitude of heterogeneous objects and interactions with physical environments. In this environment, locating desirable services is challenging due to the considerable diversity, large number, dynamic behavior, and geographical distribution of the services provided by physical objects. In this paper, we propose a context-aware semantics-based service discovery mechanism - LOCA that can effectively locate services based on the context requirements. The proposed discovery framework is built on a fully distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture which is scalable and robust. Moreover, a key feature of the discovery mechanism is its support of content and path locality. This feature can enhance the integrity of an organization and thus greatly improve the security of the organization. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies.},

abstract = {The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) has boosted the growth in number of devices around us and kindled the possibility of umpteen number of applications. One of the major challenges in the realization of IoT applications is interoperability among various IoT devices and deployments. Thus, the need for a new architecture-comprising smart control and actuation-has been identified by many researchers. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Internet-like Architecture for Things (DIAT), which will overcome most of the obstacles in the process of large-scale expansion of IoT. It specifically addresses heterogeneity of IoT devices, and enables seamless addition of new devices across applications. In addition, we propose an usage control policy model to support security and privacy in a distributed environment. We propose a layered architecture that provides various levels of abstraction to tackle the issues such as scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability. The proposed architecture is coupled with cognitive capabilities that helps in intelligent decision-making and enables automated service creation. Using a comprehensive use-case, comprising elements from multiple-application domains, we illustrate the usability of the proposed architecture.},

@article{Wu2014,
abstract = {Current research on Internet of Things (IoT) mainly focuses on how to enable general objects to see, hear, and smell the physical world for themselves, and make them connected to share the observations. In this paper, we argue that only connected is not enough, beyond that, general objects should have the capability to learn, think, and understand both physical and social worlds by themselves. This practical need impels us to develop a new paradigm, named cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT), to empower the current IoT with a “brain” for high-level intelligence. Specifically, we first present a comprehensive definition for CIoT, primarily inspired by the effectiveness of human cognition. Then, we propose an operational framework of CIoT, which mainly characterizes the interactions among five fundamental cognitive tasks: perception-action cycle, massive data analytics, semantic derivation and knowledge discovery, intelligent decision-making, and on-demand service provisioning. Furthermore, we provide a systematic tutorial on key enabling techniques involved in the cognitive tasks. In addition, we also discuss the design of proper performance metrics on evaluating the enabling techniques. Last but not the least, we present the research challenges and open issues ahead. Building on the present work and potentially fruitful future studies, CIoT has the capability to bridge the physical world (with objects, resources, etc.) and the social world (with human demand, social behavior, etc.), and enhance smart resource allocation, automatic network operation, and intelligent service provisioning.},

abstract = {Real-time analytics that requires integration and aggregation of heterogeneous and distributed streaming and static data is a typical task in many industrial scenarios such as diagnostics of turbines in Siemens. OBDA approach has a great potential to facilitate such tasks; however, it has a number of limitations in dealing with analytics that restrict its use in important industrial applications. Based on our experience with Siemens, we argue that in order to overcome those limitations OBDA should be extended and become analytics, source, and cost aware. In this work we propose such an extension. In particular, we propose an ontology, mapping, and query language for OBDA, where aggregate and other analytical functions are first class citizens. Moreover, we develop query optimisation techniques that allow to efficiently process analytical tasks over static and streaming data. We implement our approach in a system and evaluate our system with Siemens turbine data.},

abstract = {By riding the tide of sensor technologies, smart space services collects information about its surroundings and internal objects. However, sensor readings are usually at primitive stage and difficult to be viewed and further retrieved since they have little meaning for naive users, who usually prefer to identify activities or state changes using high-level semantics or concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose an ontology-driven event processing framework as part of the middleware for smart spaces. Smart space event ontology (SSEO) is developed to enable semantic indexing, detect machine-processable events and exchange event data between different processes. A model named Smart Space Event Processors (SSEP) maintains and coordinates various event processes (e.g., event patterns, ontology reasoning rules, and machine-learning algorithms) for semantic events in a smart space. An implementation of SSEP-OntoCEP is introduced. The model elaborates on event composition and semantic labeling by combining event composition technology and semantic reasoning into one coherent system. It has been applied in a smart-space infrastructure named SENSIP.},
